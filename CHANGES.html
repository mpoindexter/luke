<ul>
  <li><b>New features and improvements:</b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Add per-field value decoders, for displaying field values
        that should be interpreted as numeric or date or binary values.</li>
        <li>Improve the Analysis plugin to switch between the mixed and the only-new API.</li>
        <li>Improve visibility and layout of Thinlet tables.</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in v. 0.9.9 (released on 2009.09.30):</h3>
This release upgrades to Lucene 2.9.0 jars.

<ul>
  <li><b>New features and improvements:</b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Luke can now open multiple indexes found in subdirectories one
        level below the selected directory.</li>
        <li>Added Hadoop Plugin for working with indexes on Hadoop file systems.
	This uses Hadoop 0.19.2 and dependencies released with this release of
	Hadoop. The plugin uses partial local caching to speed up some operations.</li>
	<li>Term counts and percentages are calculated in a background thread,
	so the opening of large indexes should be a little faster. Also, this
        operation is skipped for indexes accessed over slow IO (such as HDFS).</li>
       <li>Added More Like This query builder from current document (or its
       selected fields).</li>
       <li>Search time is now monitored using System.nanoTime, and the last search time
       is preserved in the UI.</li>
       <li>Search can be now repeated N times to get a better estimate of average
       search time. Note: the measured time involves only the search(), not the retrieval
       of documents.</li>
       <li>AnalyzerTool plugin now uses and illustrates the new token Attribute API.</li>
       <li>Nearly all uses of deprecated Lucene API are replaced with the new API.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Bug fixes:</b><br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix a counter-intuitive behavior where in the Open dialog Luke
	 chops off the last path element from previously used index path.</li>
      <li>Fix XMLExporter entity escaping, and add a missing quote in term vector size.</li>
      <li>Fix a long-standing Thinlet bug related to tabbedpane with many tabs -
	now tabs don't "overflow" the tabbedpane area thus corrupting the display
	of surrounding components.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li>Opening a non-existent index from command-line creates an empty directory.
        Reported by Chris Pimlott. See also LUCENE-1464.</li>
      <li>IndexGate inadvertently deleting previous commit points, even if "Keep all commits"
        option was specified. Reported by Mark Harwood.</li>
      <li>Empty index with no fields was reported as invalid. Discovered by Andrew Zhang and Michael
        McCandless (LUCENE-1454).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in v. 0.9 (released on 2008.11.15):</h3>
This release adds many functionality enhancements and advanced features available
in Lucene 2.4.

<ul>
  <li><b>New features and improvements:</b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Added new tools:<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Check Index - checks Lucene indexes for problems, and can fix some of them.
			This is a GUI front-end to the Lucene CheckIndex tool.</li>
			<li>Export to XML - exports index data and metadata to XML file. This is
			available both from the GUI and from the command-line.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Significantly improved Optimize and Cleanup tools.</li>
        <li>Added ability to set norms on any indexed field in a document, or a range of
	documents.</li>
	<li>Delete multiple documents by specifying ranges of document numbers.</li>
        <li>Added support for new field functionality: omitTF and binary fields.</li>
	<li>Improve the low-level information about the index, including format version.</li>
	<li>Show interesting details about IndexCommit points and associated files.</li>
	<li>Add short explanations of index files' functions.</li>
	<li>Improve document reconstruction - now the information from TermFreqVector can
	be used if available. Also, DocReconstructor can be used outside of Luke.</li>
        <li>Significantly improved advanced search options - QueryParser settings, Similarity
	and HitCollector settings.</li>
        <li>Read-only functionality is supported directly in IndexReader.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Bug fixes:</b><br/>
    <p>A lot of effort went into refactoring the code, moving away if possible from the spaghetti
    code influenced by Thinlet and into a modular design. Still much needs to be done here. :(</p>
    <p>This means that there are likely many more bugs than in the previous release, although I
    tested all functionality to make sure that there is no data loss.</p>
    <p><b>HOWEVER</b>, if you work with precious data, it's always a good idea to use the
    "Read-only" option.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Changes in v. 0.8.1 (released on 2008.02.13):</h3>
This release adds a few functionality enhancements related to TermVectors and Payloads.

<ul>
  <li><b>New features and improvements:</b><br/>
    <ul>
	<li>When editing document fields it's now possible to specify TermVectors with
        offsets and/or positions.</li>
        <li>Added ability to show term vector positions and offsets, if available. It's also
        possible to copy this list to the clipboard.</li>
        <li>Added ability to show term positions within a document, and display term payloads
        if available, using one of several pre-defined payload decoders. It's also
        possible to copy this list to the clipboard.</li>
	<li>It's possible now to view the full content of a stored field using various
	content decoders (hex, date / time, number, utf8, arrays of int or float)</li>
        <li>Layout of "Browse by Term" panel is changed so that it better reflects the available
        navigation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Bug fixes:</b><br/>
    <ul>
	<li>Check added to prevent from adding new documents if no index is open.</li>
        <li>Wrong class was used in IndexGate to represent deletable files, which caused a
        ClassCastException.</li>
        <li>Some query types may have been skipped when displaying Explanation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in v. 0.8 (released on 2008.02.04):</h3>
<p>This release upgrades to the official Lucene 2.3.0 release JARs.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> this version of Luke requires Java 1.5 or higher.</p>
<p>The following changes have been made in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>New features and improvements:</b><br/>
    <ul>
	<li>Added ability to show full text of a field in a popup dialog, both in
	plain text and as a hexadecimal dump.</li>
	<li>It's also possible to save the content of a single field to an external file.
	This is useful for saving binary fields, or examining exact byte content of a field.</li>
	<li>Added an option to load the index to RAMDirectory. NOTE: obviously you should take into
	account the index size vs. the available heap size ... ;) </li>
	<li>GrowableStringArray is a separate public class now - perhaps some day I'll use it to implement
	a bulk document reconstruct function.</li>
	<li>Luke remembers now the last Analyzer and last field used in previous session. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Bug fixes:</b><br/>
    <ul>
	<li>Neither the document nor the field details have the "Boost" column anymore, it's always 1.0f
        in documents retrieved from an index. Instead this column now reads "Norms" and shows the fieldNorm
        value of a field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in v. 0.7.1 (released on 2007.06.20):</h3>

<p>The following changes have been made in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>New features and improvements:</b><br/>
    <ul>
	<li>Added pagination of results, especially useful for very large
	result sets.</li>
	<li>Added support for new Field flags. They are now
	displayed in the Document details, and also can be set on
	edited documents.</li>
	<li>Added a function to add new documents to the index.</li>
	<li>Low-level index operations (such as detecting unused files,
	index directory cleanup) use the newly exposed Lucene classes
	instead of duplicating their internals in Luke.</li>
	<li>A side-effect of the above is the ability to properly
	cleanup all supported index formats, including the new lockless
	and single-norm indexes.</li>
	<li>Added a function to copy the list of top terms to clipboard.</li>
	<li>Added a function to copy the term vector to clipboard.</li>

	added graphics instead of ASCII art, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Bug fixes:</b><br/>
    <ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in index size calculation.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in term browsing - when "First Term" was pressed
	in reality the second term was shown.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Changes in v. 0.6:</h3>
<p>This release uses Lucene JAR named <code>lucene-1.9-rc1-dev.jar</code>.
This JAR and all other JARs from Lucene repository were built from
SVN revision 154013.</p>
<p>This release adds new important features such as custom Similarity
and JavaScript scripting (using Mozilla Rhino engine). Here's a more
detailed list of changes and bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>New features, improvements and bug fixes:</b><br/>
	<ul>
		<li>The query view shows not only a parsed form, but also
	       	a re-written query form.</li>
		<li>Query Explanation shows internal structure of a query.
		Explanations are provided both for the parsed and rewritten
		queries.</li>
		<li>Command-line argument parsing. Now you can open an index
		on startup, and optionally execute a script (see below)</li>
		<li>Custom Similarity designer plugin, which
		allows you to design and test your own Similarity
		implementation.</li>
		<li>Scripting plugin, which allows you to interactively
		experiment with Luke and Lucene indexes. This plugin also
		can run scripts from Luke command-line.</li>
		<li>Ability to use MMapDirectory. Due to limitations in
		Lucene API this feature relies on reflection API, and may
		sometimes fail if a restrictive SecurityManager is in use.
		The Overview panel shows which Directory implementation is used.</li>
		<li>Proper display of overlapping tokens (created with analyzers
		that use setPositionIncrement(0) ).</li>
		<li>Field names are sorted in alphabetical order.</li>
		<li>Document boost is shown, in addition to each field's boost.</li>
		<li>The "Files" tab now shows which files found in the index
		directory really belong to the index, and what is their
	       	status.</li>
		<li>A new function, "Index Cleanup", cleans up all files from
	       	index directory that do not belong to the index, and all
		files that are marked as deletable in the index.</li>
		<li>Luke has been reviewed and restructured to provide better
		support for execution as a part of other applications (or
		JavaScript scripts). Javadoc comments were added.</li>
		<li>The default binary bundle (lukeall.jar) now contains also
		a collection of analyzers from the "contrib" area, as well as
		the Snowball analyzers.</li>
		<li>UI font selection: sometimes the field values contain
		characters not covered in the default 'dialog' font, like
	       	e.g. less common Unicode glyphs.
		Or maybe you just wish to view all UI text rendered in
	       	Garamond... now you can ;-)</li>
		<li>UI color theme: you can now switch color themes for
		your eye's pleasure.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>Bug fixes:</b><br/>
